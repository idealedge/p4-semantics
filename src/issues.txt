- Page 59,
exp ::=
exp bin_op exp | un_op exp | field_ref |
value | ( exp )
What is value? Is it const_value?


- Page 27,
counter_declaration ::=
counter counter_name {
type : counter_type ;
[ direct_or_static ; ]
[ instance_count : const_expr ; ]
[ min_width : const_expr ; ]
[ saturating ; ]
}
meter_declaration ::=
meter meter_name {
type : meter_type ;
[ result : field_ref ; ]
[ direct_or_static ; ]
[ instance_count : const_expr ; ]
}
What is const_expr? Is it const_value?


- What is atomic? What happens if a new rule is received while processing a packet?
- Does packets get processed in parallel or sequentially? (it affects the semantics)

- How exactly unparsing works?

- Page 13
 field_list_declaration ::=
 field_list field_list_name {
 [ field_list_entry ; ] +
 }
 field_list_entry ::=
 field_ref | header_ref | field_value | field_list_name | payload
 field_ref ::= header_ref . field_name
 header_ref ::= instance_name | instance_name "[" index "]"
 index ::= const_value | last
 Does it mean we can have hdr [ last ] in field_list_declaration ?


- FieldRefs in functions (actions_ are different from FieldRefs in other places such as field_list_dec or return select
  In the former, FieldRefs are actually reference to fields, in the later they are the value of the fields
